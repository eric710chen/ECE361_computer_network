## File Transfer
An easy part of lab lasting for the first 8 weeks.
The implementation in this repo is naive since I did not use `select` for non-blocking receiving.

## Text Conferencing
A intensive working lab at the last 4 weeks of semester. Better start early for this lab. The protocol itself it not hard to deal with. You can just copy some boil-plate code from `Beej's Guide` as a good start. Most of the time you are going to deal with API design. It took me around 8 hours to finish this lab.

## Please Reference Only (NO DIRECT COPY)
These are the detailed labwork for this course. Handouts are also included in the repository for people who would like to attempt prior to the start of the course. After all, please Reference ONLY, the repo is not for someone who is not willingly to do the prelab.
